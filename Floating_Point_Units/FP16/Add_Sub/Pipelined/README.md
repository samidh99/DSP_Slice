The design contains a FP16 addition/ subtraction unit with Prealign, Align, Execute, Normalize, Normalize Shifting and Round modules. The floating point format used is a simplified IEEE754 Single precision standard and supports the helf precision IEEE754 rounding mode (round to nearest, tie to even) and all the exception flags. Signalling NaNs are not supported, neither are denormalized numbers. The design is a 9 pipelined implementation.
