   Multiplier and adder units. 
   
   2.1 ieee\_fp16: These are IEEE floating point 16-bit versions of the multiplier and adder units in the DSP48E1-FP directory above (Author: Zhigang Wei)
   
   2.2 fixed\_point\_8: These are 8-bit fixed point multiplier and adder units. Super simple. For testing out some synthesis tool quirks.
