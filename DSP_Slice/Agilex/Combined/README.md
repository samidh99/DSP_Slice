The slice contains the fixed point 9*9, 18*19, 27*27 and Floating Point 16 and 32 modes.

The numbers are very similar after scaling for technology nodes. 
For the Agilex-like DSP slice, the overall delay came out to be 2.97ns in floating point mode and 2.55ns in fixed point mode. 
Scaling down to 10nm, this is about 740 MHz in floating point mode and 861 MHz in fixed point mode. (Scaling reference: http://vcl.ece.ucdavis.edu/pubs/2017.02.VLSIintegration.TechScale/)
This is similar to numbers from the Agilex datasheet (750 MHz and 900 MHz respectively).
