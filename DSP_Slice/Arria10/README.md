Fixed Point (18X19, 27X27 and combined) modes implemented

**Some features from the Arria 10 DSP Slice:**

• High-performance, power-optimized, and fully registered multiplication operations

• 18-bit and 27-bit word lengths

• Two 18 × 19 multipliers or one 27 × 27 multiplier per DSP block

• Built-in addition, subtraction, and 64-bit double accumulation register to combine multiplication results

• Cascading 64-bit output bus to propagate output results from one block to the next block without external logic support

• Hard pre-adder supported in 19-bit and 27-bit modes for symmetric filters

• Internal coefficient register bank in both 18-bit and 27-bit modes for filter implementation
